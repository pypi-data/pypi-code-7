"""
Import variable into your Django settings.py file, and whenever you define a
variable that could change depending on where the project is deployed, use
something like:

    DEBUG = variable("DEBUG")
    DEBUG = variable("DEBUG", default=False)

Here is a more useful example:

    import os

    # This needs to be a cryptographically secure random string. The default is
    # fine.
    SECRET_KEY = variable("SECRET_KET", os.urandom(64).decode("latin1"))

When your settings file is interpreted, a call to variable will look in a
variables module (which must be in your python path somewhere) to find the value
of the setting. If it is not defined, you are prompted to enter a valid Python
expression to set it, which is then written to the variables.py file in the
location of __main__
